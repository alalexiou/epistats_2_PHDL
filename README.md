Practical: Exploring trends and inequalities in life expectancy by area-level in England


Introduction

While the average life expectancy in England has been increasing during the past decades, even before the pandemic the rate of improvement has slowed down considerably. There is a lot of debate as to why, with one of the causes mentioned being austerity.Another key issue that many studies have also focused on during the period since 2010, is whether inequalities or the gap between the least and most disadvantaged groups has increased.

    In this study we will examine how life expectancy (LE) at birth in England has evolved in recent years.
    We will also focus on the geographical inequalities of LE across local authorities. In particular, we will focus on LE inequalities that are associated with deprivation and income level.
    We will then carry out a cross-sectional analysis on the relationships between life expectancy at birth and income at the Local Authority (LA) level, using a simple regression model.


Outline of the practical

This practical session demonstrates a step-by-step analysis on life expectancy and inequalities in England. It covers some key aspects of such studies, from getting the necessary data to building a simple model exploring the relationships between life expectancy and the social determinants of health. We will use aggregated data at Local Authority level to perform the analysis (known as an ecological study).

In general, this practical should run smoothly; everything should be contained within the script, including downloading data. Furthermore, we have included several “optional” tasks about the analysis that you can do.

This practical is trying to keep to Base R as much as possible (i.e. without using third-party libraries), with some exceptions. It also assume you run this within RStudio (tested for Version 1.1.453 and R version 3.6.1), which is free and you can find here.

By the end of the practical, you should be able to:
– Read data into R.
– Identify data structures.
– Subset, clean and re-code data.
– Find missing values and outliers.
– Join data tables based on common variables.
– Summarise and plot data.
– Calculate variable relationships.
– Calculate linear regression models.

There are also some sections included in a text-box; these are generally optional, but they do contain additional information, exercises, or remind you some things from previous practicals.
